# WowMirror

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## About the Code

Honestly I'm not using best practices at all on this project. I wanted to finish my smart mirror in Angular asap. I got this inspiration from here: https://magicmirror.builders/. The original project uses Electron :)
